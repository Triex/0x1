# 0x1 Framework CLI Refactoring

## ✅ Completed Tasks

1. **Server Consolidation**:
   - Integrated standalone-server.ts functionality into dev-server.ts
   - Added proper error handling and improved live reload

2. **Middleware Implementation**:
   - Copied error-boundary.ts from core to middleware for elegant error responses
   - Implemented static-files.ts with proper MIME types and caching

3. **Utility Functions**:
   - Created network.ts for port and IP management
   - Added shutdown.ts for graceful termination handling
   - Moved component utilities to components.ts
   - Enhanced transpilation.ts for better JSX/TSX handling

4. **Removed JavaScript Adapters**:
   - Eliminated .js adapter files in favor of direct TypeScript imports
   - Standardized on TypeScript throughout the codebase

5. **Improved Build Process**:
   - Enhanced component discovery and building
   - Added reliable application bundle creation
   - Implemented proper temp file cleanup

## Directory Structure

The CLI now follows this improved directory structure:

```
src/cli/
├── commands/             # CLI commands (dev, build, etc.)
├── server/               # Server implementation
│   ├── middleware/       # Server middleware
│   ├── handlers/         # Request handlers
│   └── utils/            # Server-specific utilities
└── utils/                # General utilities
```

## Next Steps

1. **Testing**: Thoroughly test all commands and server functionality
2. **Documentation**: Update documentation to reflect the new structure
3. **Performance**: Optimize build processes for faster development experience

## Best Practices Implemented

- Strict TypeScript typing for better reliability
- Consistent error handling throughout the codebase
- Better separation of concerns with modular code organization
- Enhanced user feedback with informative logs

This refactoring provides a solid foundation for future CLI improvements and feature additions while maintaining clean, maintainable, and well-structured code.
